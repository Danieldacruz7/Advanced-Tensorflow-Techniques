# Advanced-Tensorflow-Techniques
A collection of projects focused on improving AI models using Tensorflow. 

The 4 main topics include computer vision, model layer customization, distributed training and generative adversarial networks. 

## 1. Advanced Computer Vision:

- ### Cat vs Dogs Saliency Maps
    Saliency maps provide an explanation for predictions in convolutional neural networks. After training the neural network on images of cats and dogs and differentiating between the two, saliency maps will highlight the areas within images that allowed the neural network to make an accurate prediction.
